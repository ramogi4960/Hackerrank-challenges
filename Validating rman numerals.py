# in this task, we take in an input as a string then determine if it's a roman number or not
# we print True if it is else False
# to validate if the string is a roman number, we need to first know how to represent roman numbers
# a roman number within range(1, 4000) can either start with either I, V, X, L, C or D
# all numbers in range(1, 10) have to start with I, V
# all numbers in range(10, 50) have to start with X
# all numbers in range(50, 90) have to start with L
# all numbers in range(90, 100) have to start with XC
